# Attendance App

The Attendance App is a simple web application that allows you to manage and track student attendance on a timetable. Students can be added, and their attendance status for each day of the week can be recorded as either "Present" or "Absent".

## Features

- Timetable-style attendance tracking.
- Color-coded cells to differentiate between "Present" and "Absent" attendance.
- Ability to add new students and edit their names.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd attendance-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Usage

1. The app displays a timetable-like grid where students' attendance can be recorded.
2. Click on a cell to toggle between "Present" and "Absent" attendance.
3. To add a new student, enter their name in the input field and click "Add Student".
4. To edit a student's name, click the "Edit" button next to the student's name, update the name, and press Enter or click outside the input field.
